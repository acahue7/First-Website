    <h1> Home Alone: A Christmas Classic </h1>
    <p>It can be hard to narrow down a favorite Christmas movie, but there’s no denying that certain ones are certified classics. Home Alone is one of those classics, and because of that, it is a staple watch during the holiday season for many. It’s for good reason too. Despite being released in 1990, Home Alone has stood the test of time, and never fails to bring the Christmas season into full effect. With a charming story and plenty of laughs, Home Alone appeals to viewers of all ages, making it the perfect choice for a family movie night or just a cozy night in. Many moments stand out in the film, from Catherine O’Hara’s iconic screaming of “KEVIN!”, to Kevin’s (Macaulay Culkin) countless pranks and booby traps. But the scene that has always stood out to me happens towards the end of the film, after all the traps have been set and the bad guys have been defeated. And though it’s brief in length, it’s a scene that is chock-full of warmth and Christmas spirit. </p>

    <p>Home Alone follows the extended (and rowdy) McCallister family the night before their big family trip to Paris. Kevin McCallister, however, isn’t having the best time, and after a series of mishaps that ruin dinner, he’s punished by his mom and sent to bed early. To make matters worse, he has to sleep in the attic for the night due to the full house! In retaliation, Kevin storms up the stairs, yelling that he wishes his family would just disappear. As fate would have it, a winter storm knocks out the power, causing all of the alarm clocks to reset and send the family into a frenzy. As the family rushes to gather their things, a head count is done to make sure all the kids are accounted for. But unbeknownst to the family, one of the kids they counted is not actually Kevin, just a friend who'd come to say bye and is not accompanying them on the trip. And so the McCallisters set off in a rush without a clue as to what – or rather who – they've just forgotten. Kevin awakens to find the house empty, but the garage still filled with the family’s cars. This can only mean one thing to him: he made his family disappear. Kevin does as any kid would do with a parent-free household and indulges in ice cream for dinner, and movies that he’s not usually allowed to watch. But his newfound freedom is suddenly jeopardized when he discovers that a pair of burglars have targeted his home. Kevin is forced to defend his home and sets up an elaborate array of booby traps to thwart the burglar’s plans, with hilarious succession.</p>
